# penalty-kick-analysis-top-5-leagues

This is an exploratory analysis of the expected goals metric as it pertains to penalty kicks using [FBref's API](https://fbrapi.com/documentation#team-season-stats) - Team Season Statistics json.

The goal of this project is to compare penalty kicks from the top 5 European leagues of ⚽ (English Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and La Liga) over the last 5 years and compare the conversion ratio of these shots against the determined probability of a chance conversion - pxG = 0.79.

xG is a metric that has become increasingly popular in ⚽ to calculate the probability of a team scoring from a single shot. The probability is determined by several factors including where the shot was taken from (distance and angle from goal), how the shot was taken (stronger foot, weaker foot, head, bouncing ball, etc.), and other factors.

	**Is penalty xG being underestimated? overestimated?**
  Are there teams or leagues that massively overperform/underperform at penalty kicks?
